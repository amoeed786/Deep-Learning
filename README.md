# Deep Learning Course Repository

Welcome to my Deep Learning Course repository! This repository contains all my materials, notes, assignments, and projects from my Deep Learning course, which I am studying in my 7th semester with **Dr. Kamran Malik**.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

Deep Learning is a branch of Machine Learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data. This course covers a variety of deep learning techniques, from the basics to advanced topics, helping students develop a solid foundation and practical skills in this growing field.

### Topics Covered
- **Fundamentals of Neural Networks**: Structure, backpropagation, and optimization
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Image processing and applications in computer vision
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Sequential data processing and applications in NLP

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Assignments**: Solutions and explanations for all course assignments.
- **Projects**: Mini-projects and final project(s) demonstrating deep learning applications.
- **Resources**: Additional readings, research papers, and books.
- **Lectures**: Slides which are content of this course.
